# SnakeGame
This project is basically the typical snake game,
I coded it using C

The game code is based on these 3 main phases:
  + Clearing the screen and initializing it
  + Moving elements (objects)
  + Drawing elements in the new positions

Controls:
  w: move up
  s: move down
  d: move right
  a: move left


Here is a preview for the game:
